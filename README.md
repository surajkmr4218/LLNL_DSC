This repository holds my code from Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory's Data Science Challenge from July - August 2024. 

The challenge consisted of four different tasks: 
1. Binary Classification - Classify heartbeat signals as abnormal or normal
2. Multiclass Classification - Classify heartbeat signals as one of five different categories
3. Activation Peak Time Mapping - Predict the activation peak times for 12 standard lead ECG data
4. Transmembrane Voltage Mapping - Predict activation graphs for 12 standard lead ECG data
